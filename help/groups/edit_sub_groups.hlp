Sub groups can be difficult to understand at first, but once you get the
hang of it this can be a very powerful feature.  Each group has multiple
sets of propagation preferences. The first set is the parent propagation
settings.  These settings determine whether or not the information from
the parent group will propogate to the sub groups (children).  To toggle
one of these settings simply click on the icon. There are also propagation 
settings for each child.  These settings determine whether or not the 
information from the children will propogate up to the parent.  To toggle 
one of these settings simply click on the icon.

In the case of user propagation, if a user belongs to multiple children
or already belongs to both the parent and a child group then the user's
permission set will be the one granting them the most access.  So if the
given user is a Technician in one of the children, but Group Administrator
in another, the permission set for said user will be Group Administrator
for all children and parent, if user propagation is enabled.
