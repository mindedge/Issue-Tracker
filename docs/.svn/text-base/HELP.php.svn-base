Issue-Tracker Help System
-------------------------
  Issue-Tracker has a very basic help system.  In the root Issue-Tracker
directory you should have a directory named, oddly enough, help.  This
directory should contain basic text/html files that relate to the modules 
and actions of Issue-Tracker, and as of the writing of this file the help
directory is completely empty, UGH!  As stated though the help system is
very basic and easy to setup.  The Issue-Tracker framework will look in
the help directory each page view for a help file matching the current
module/action combination and if the file exists then the Help link will
appear in the upper right hand corner.  If the link doesn't appear then
no matching help file was found.
  Creating help files is very easy also.  Each help file is simply a text
file that can contain any standard html.  The file is simply included into
the help template.  The naming convention for help files is as simple as
well.  For each module there should exist a directory inside the help
directory, then inside of the module directory, one help file per action
for that module.  The action help files should be named exactly the same
as the action but with a .hlp extension.  Also you can create a help file
for the module itself but creating a help file in the main help directory
named the same as the module with a .hlp extension.
