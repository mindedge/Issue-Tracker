Issue-Tracker v4.0 (The Grape)
------------------------------
  
  Well after quite some time in beta, 4.0 is now gold and available to the
general public.  This release includes a massive amount of bug fixes and
enhancements so I would definately recommend those running an older version
of Issue-Tracker upgrade when you get a chance.  If you need any help with
data migration from v3 to the next database structure you can reach me at
tm@tuxmonkey.com.  For those of you still running the quite old v2 or even
v1 releases, I'm sorry but the differences in functionality and database
structure is just too large to convert the data without having to fudge
quite a bit of information.
  As always if you find any bugs, have a comment, or just want to rant, you
can catch me on the project forums at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/issue-tracker/

  See the CHANGELOG file for a list of changes between v3 and v4.

                                              - Edwin {Tuxmonkey}
